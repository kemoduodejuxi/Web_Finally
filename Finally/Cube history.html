<h1>The History of Rubik's Cube</h1>

<table>
<tr>
<td><h3>The Rubik's Cube, also known as the Rubik's Cube, was first invented by Professor Ernő Rubik of the Budapest School of Architecture in Hungary in 1974. Rubik's Cube has racing, blind twist, single twist and other ways of playing, popular degree has not declined, will be held every year the size of the event, is one of the most popular intelligence games. Generally speaking, the Rubik's Cube refers to the third order Rubik's Cube in the narrow sense. The shape of a Rubik's cube is usually a cube. The normal racing game is to disrupt the cube and then restore it in the shortest possible time. The Rubik's Cube, in its broad sense, refers to all kinds of geometry that can be disturbed and restored by rotation.</h3></td>

<td><h3>In March 1970, Larry Nichols invented the Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups, which was patented in Canada. It was a 2×2×2 Rubik's cube, but each cube was attached to each other by magnets. U.S. Patent No. 3,655,201 was granted in 1972, two years earlier than Professor Rubik's cube.</h3></td>

<td><h3>Ernő Rubik, a professor of architecture and sculpture in Hungary, created the first rubik's cube, inspired by the gravel of the Danube River, in order to help his students understand the composition and structure of space cubes. Professor Rubik created the first Rubik's Cube (then known as the Magic Cube) in 1974 and received a Hungarian patent number, HU170062, in 1975, but did not apply for an international patent. The first Rubik's Cubes were sold in Budapest toy shops in 1977. Unlike Nichols's Rubik's Cube, Professor Rubik's pieces are wedged together like tenons, not easily pulled apart by force, and can be made of any material.</h3></td>

<h3>In September 1979, Ideal Toys brought the Rubik's Cube to the world and was presented at the International Toy Fairs in London, Paris and the USA in January/February 1980. After the show, Ideal Toys changed the name of the Cube to Rubik's Cube and in May 1980 the first cubes were exported from Hungary.</h3>
